# aurelia-test-karma-bones

This repo was built from scratch, to determine the minimum set of dependencies and configuration
necessary to run Jasmine tests with Karama, on an Aurelia project bundled with Webpack.

The project does not do anything special, and is made available as a reference for others in the community
who are trying (and struggling) to get the above combination to work.

## Running The Tests

	npx karma start
